                    <p>Had a great experience here. Pharmacy looks small but carries all you might need. They take all kind of insurances (including Kaiser) and accepts HSA too. Service is personal, friendly, and quick. Definitely beat waiting in line at CVS for the employees to give you side eyes. Verdict: highly recommended.</p>

                    <p>Bara pharmacy is by far the best pharmacy that I have ever been too, and as a cancer survivor with a 2 1/2 year long fight, I have used quite a few pharmacies. He always has a smile on his face and he takes the time to remember things about you that you have told him when he makes you feel welcomed with great conversation! I would 10/10 recommend this pharmacy to anyone I know and anyone that I dont know. I cannot say enough fantastic things about bara. Try out the pharmacy and see for yourself just how nice and amazing a sinple trip to the pharmacy can be for you!</p>
